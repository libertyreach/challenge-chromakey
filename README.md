# Coding Challenge: Real-Time Chroma-Key Studio

## Overview
The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate your proficiency in **C++17 (or newer)**, the **Qt Framework**, and **OpenCV**. You will build a desktop application that allows a user to perform "Chroma-Keying" (green-screen replacement) on a video file in real-time.

## The Problem Statement
Create a "Virtual Background" application that replaces a specific color in a video stream with the contents of a still background image.

---

## Key Technical Requirements

### 1. Functional Requirements
* **Media Loading:** Load a video file (`.mp4`) and a background image (`.png`) via the Qt UI.
* **Playback Control:** Provide Play, Pause, and Restart buttons to control the video view.
* **Interactive Selection:** Allow the user to click a pixel in the video feed to "pick" the key color.
* **Real-Time Processing:** Replace the key color with the background image dynamically as the video plays.

### 2. Technical Constraints
* **Framework:** Qt 6.x (preferred) or Qt 5.15.
* **Processing:** OpenCV 4.x.
* **Language:** C++17 or higher.
* **Threading:** The UI thread **must** remain responsive (non-blocking). Processing logic must run on a dedicated worker thread.
* **Memory Management:** Avoid unnecessary deep copies of image buffers every frame. Demonstrate proper use of RAII and QObject parent-child ownership.

## Provided Assets
Please use the following assets for your development and testing:
* **Video:** `green_screen_countdown.mp4`
* **Background:** `background.png`
* This template project.

## Setup & Build Instructions

### Linux / macOS
Ensure you have CMake, Qt, and OpenCV installed via your package manager (`apt` or `brew`).

```bash
# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and Build
cmake ..
make

# Run
./ChromaKeyStudio

```

### Windows (Recommended via vcpkg)

We recommend using `vcpkg` to manage dependencies to avoid pathing issues.

```powershell
# 1. Install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install qt6:x64-windows opencv:x64-windows

# 2. Configure using the vcpkg toolchain
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="C:/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -A x64

# 3. Build
cmake --build . --config Release

```

## Evaluation Rubric

Your submission will be graded on the following:

| Category | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| **Qt & Architecture** | Thread safety, Signal/Slot usage, non-blocking UI, and layout management. |
| **Modern C++** | Use of C++17 features, type safety, and avoiding raw `new/delete`. |
| **Image Processing** | Choice of color space (e.g., HSV vs RGB), mask refinement, and efficiency. |
| **Code Quality** | Error handling (e.g., file not found), documentation, and build system cleanliness. |

---

## Submission Instructions

1. Ensure your code is well-commented and follows a consistent naming convention.
2. Provide a short write-up in your final submission explaining:
* Your architectural choices for threading and data transfer.
* Why you chose your specific image processing approach.


3. Include your `CMakeLists.txt` and all source files. Do **not** include build artifacts or binaries.

**Good luck! We look forward to seeing your solution.**
